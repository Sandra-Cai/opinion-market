# Example: Data Asset -> Monitoring -> Governance -> Microservices
asset = await data_governance_engine.register_data_asset(asset_data)
await advanced_monitoring_engine._record_metric(f"asset_size_{asset.asset_id}", asset.size_bytes, MetricType.GAUGE)
service_instance = await microservices_engine.register_service(ServiceType.ANALYTICS)
integrated_record = {
    "asset_id": asset.asset_id,
    "service_id": service_instance.instance_id,
    "monitoring_active": True,
    "governance_compliant": True
}
await enhanced_cache.set(f"integration_{asset.asset_id}", integrated_record)
```

### Main Application Integration
All enterprise services are integrated into the main FastAPI application with proper lifecycle management:

```python
# Startup
await advanced_monitoring_engine.start_monitoring_engine()
await data_governance_engine.start_governance_engine()
await microservices_engine.start_microservices_engine()

# Shutdown
